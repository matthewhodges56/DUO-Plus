# DUO Plus

### Overview
This repository contains the early development files for the **DUO Plus**.  The goal is to rebuild DUO Mission’s existing system from scratch using a modern, role-based structure that supports client registration, check-in, and service tracking.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Plain HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap (HopeUI Theme)  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** Local MySQL  
- **Documentation:** OneNote

### Current Structure
- /assets → CSS, JS, images, and HopeUI theme files
- /api → PHP backend endpoints
- /pages → Frontend HTML pages (role-based dashboards)
- /db → MySQL schema export

### Notes
- This setup is **temporary** and will evolve as the rebuild progresses.
